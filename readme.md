## Project Flyer

Focused on my improvement as a developer, the Project Flyer follows many of the techniques tought by Jeffrey Way on his site Laracasts.

**Important note!** Site has being updated to GitHub to show how I'm working under a developement environment, not a production one.

## Technologies

Developed with [Laravel 5.2](http://laravel.com/docs).

Also used:
- Bootstrap 3
- jQuery

## Dev. status

Currently working on this project, so stay tunned for more updates.

## Design patters and good practices applied

Some of good practices and techniques applied are:

##### Query scopes

```
public function scopeLocatedAt($query,$zip, $street)
{
    return $query->where(compact('zip','street'))->firstOrFail();
}
```

##### Mutators

```
public function getPriceAttribute($price)
{
    return number_format($price,2,',','.') . 'â‚¬';
}
```

##### Named routes

```
action="{{ route('store_photo_path',['zip' => $flyer->zip, 'street' => $flyer->street]) }}"
```
